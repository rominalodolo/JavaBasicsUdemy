## History of programming languages 

### Types of programming languages
- Low level languages 
  - Machine Learning
  - Assembly Language 

- High level languages 
  - C 
  - C++
  - Java   

## What is Java?

* a computing platform that was first released by SUn Microsystems in 1995
* runs on all platforms, free to access
* an independent programming language - logic: "write once, run anywhere" so you can run the compiled code on all java suported systems
* Class-based and OOP language 
* Concurrent meaning you can execute many statements rather than sequential execution.


## Components in Java

### JVM (Java virtual machine)
An abstract machine: a specification providing run-time environment where bytecode is executed. Assembly language.

### JRE (Java runtime environment)
JRE refers to a runtime environment where bytecode is executed.

### JDK (Java development kit)
JDK inculdes JRE which included tools for java programers.

## Data Types and variables

* NUMBER: byte, short, int, long
* DECIMAL: float, double
* TRUE/FALSE: boolean
* CHARACTERS: Char

Storing a group of characters is done in a STRING `""`

Variables: 
- A temporay way to store data types 
- How to declare a variable: 
  - `<Data_Type> Variable_name;`
  - Data_Type may be a byte, short, int, long, float, etc. 
  - Variables_name is an identifier which you specify with these conditions:
    - May contain letters
    - case sensitive
    - avoid using reserved keywords like public, static, void, etc.
